      <h2>About</h2>
      <div>
        <img src="logo.jpg" alt="img">
        <p>There is a big demand on the fashion shopping business nowadays
          especially the online fashion shopping which makes it easier for the
          customer from one side and for the management staff from the other side. So
          we intended to automate all business processes, among those automation is
          the company website. The customer can do all his work on the website
          without facing difficulties in moving around to find vendors needed for his
          fashion since the website shortens all available services and products in the
          company.</p><br>
          <p>
          We hope that our website will be an adding to the company by attracting
          customers from everywhere and gain an advantage over competition. The
          fashion shopping online system increases the companyâ€™s competitive
          advantage through becoming more customers focused, and will hopefully
          create a tight bond with its customers.
          The system was found feasible and thus, applicable. With little effort the
          system can be easily maintained and upgraded.</p>
